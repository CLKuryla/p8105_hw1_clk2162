The following document is the first homework for P8105.

# Problem 1

First, load `early_january_weather` from the `penguins` dataset in the
library `moderndive` as well as the tidyverse.

``` r
# Load moderndive library 
library(moderndive)

# Load tidyverse for dplyr to enable pull when calculating the mean temperature
library(tidyverse)

# This laods the early_january_weather dataset into a variable called early_january_weather
data("early_january_weather")
```

- The variables in this data set were: origin, year, month, day, hour,
  temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
  visib, time_hour.
  - Some important variables included:
    - `origin`, which was EWR for every measurement.
    - Year (`year`) and month (`month`), which were the same for every
      observation: 2013 and 1, respectively.
    - Several weather measurements were included, such as
      - Temperature (`temp`), which ranged from 24.08 to 57.92.
      - Dew point (`dewp`), which ranged from 8.96 to 53.06.
      - Humidity (`humid`), which ranged from 32.86 to 100.
      - Details about the wind, such as the direction (`wind_dir`),
        speed (`wind_speed`), and gusts (`wind_gust`).
      - Precipitation (`precip`), which ranged from 0 to 0.19.
      - Pressure (`pressure`), which which had some missing values but
        ranged from 1010.8 to 1034.4.
      - Visibility (`visib`), which had some missing values but ranged
        from 0.12 to 10.
- The data set contained 358 observations (rows) with 15 variables
  (columns) describing each observation.
- The mean temperature was 39.5821229.

``` r
# Create a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x) colored using the humid variable

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r
# Save the plot

ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf")
```

In the plot of the temperature vs the date/time, we can see that:

- The data measurements exist from 2013-01-01 01:00:00 to 2013-01-15
  23:00:00 and the temperature ranges from 24.08 to 57.92.
- There is an overall upwards trend in the data, so it seems that as
  time passes from early to mid January, the temperature warms overall.
- It is also apparent that the temperature fluctuates throughout the
  time measurements, which probably represents the fluctuation of
  temperature during the day and night cycles.
- The color of the points seems to go from a dark blue to a lighter blue
  as time passes, which means that the humidity increases as the
  measurements go from early to mid January.

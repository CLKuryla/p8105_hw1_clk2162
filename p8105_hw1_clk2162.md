The following document is the first homework for P8105.

# Problem 1

First, load `early_january_weather` from the `penguins` dataset in the
library `moderndive` as well as the tidyverse.

``` r
# Load moderndive library 
library(moderndive)

# Load tidyverse for dplyr to enable pull when calculating the mean temperature
library(tidyverse)

# This laods the early_january_weather dataset into a variable called early_january_weather
data("early_january_weather")
```

- The variables in this data set were: origin, year, month, day, hour,
  temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
  visib, time_hour.
  - Some important variables included:
    - `origin`, which was EWR for every measurement.
    - Year (`year`) and month (`month`), which were the same for every
      observation: 2013 and 1, respectively.
    - Several weather measurements were included, such as
      - Temperature (`temp`), which ranged from 24.08 to 57.92.
      - Dew point (`dewp`), which ranged from 8.96 to 53.06.
      - Humidity (`humid`), which ranged from 32.86 to 100.
      - Details about the wind, such as the direction (`wind_dir`),
        speed (`wind_speed`), and gusts (`wind_gust`).
      - Precipitation (`precip`), which ranged from 0 to 0.19.
      - Pressure (`pressure`), which which had some missing values but
        ranged from 1010.8 to 1034.4.
      - Visibility (`visib`), which had some missing values but ranged
        from 0.12 to 10.
- The data set contained 358 observations (rows) with 15 variables
  (columns) describing each observation.
- The mean temperature was 39.5821229.

``` r
# Create a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x) colored using the humid variable

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r
# Save the plot

ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

In the plot of the temperature vs the date/time, we can see that:

- The data measurements exist from 2013-01-01 01:00:00 to 2013-01-15
  23:00:00 and the temperature ranges from 24.08 to 57.92.
- There is an overall upwards trend in the data, so it seems that as
  time passes from early to mid January, the temperature warms overall.
- It is also apparent that the temperature fluctuates throughout the
  time measurements, which probably represents the fluctuation of
  temperature during the day and night cycles.
- The color of the points seems to go from a dark blue to a lighter blue
  as time passes, which means that the humidity increases as the
  measurements go from early to mid January.

# Problem 2

``` r
# Create a dataframe

dataframe_problem_2 <- tibble(
  samp_norm = rnorm(10),
  greater_than_0 = samp_norm > 0,
  char_vec = c("C", "h", "a", "r", "a", "c", "t", "e", "r", "!"),
  factor_vec = as.factor(c("pink", "green", "blue", "pink", "pink", "pink", "green", "blue", "pink", "green"))
)

# Take the mean of each column of the data frame
mean(pull(dataframe_problem_2, samp_norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.2199379

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe_problem_2, greater_than_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe_problem_2, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe_problem_2, char_vec)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe_problem_2, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe_problem_2, factor_vec)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

- Taking the mean of the sample created following the normal
  distribution worked: -0.2199379
- Taking the mean of the logical vector worked: 0.4. This was likely the
  mean of 4 1’s (TRUE) and 6 0’s (FALSE).
- As expected, taking the mean of the character vector did not work: NA
- As expected, taking the mean of the factor vector did not work either:
  NA.

``` r
# Apply the as numeric function to the logical (greater_than_0), character (char_vec), and factor vectors (factor_vec)

as.numeric(pull(dataframe_problem_2, greater_than_0))
as.numeric(pull(dataframe_problem_2, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(dataframe_problem_2, factor_vec))
```

Results of applying the as.numeric function:

- When applied to the logical vector, the as.numeric function converts
  the vector to 1’s for TRUE and 0’s for FALSE.
- For the character vector, the as.numeric function results in all NA,
  which makes sense because converting characters to numbers is
  nonsensical.
- For the factor vector, the as.numeric function results in a vector
  containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. This is the rank of the levels of
  the factors created.

This explains what happens when we tried to take the mean of the
respective vectors.

- The mean of four 1’s and six 0’s is 0.4, which corresponds to the mean
  for the logical vector.
- The mean of the character vector did not work because that doesn’t
  make sense, and the mean of ten NAs also doesn’t make sense.
- The mean of the factor vector did not work because factors are
  categorical variables, so a mean doesn’t make sense.
